                        I have just arrived home from work and looked closely at the trip itinerary and hotels that you selected for us. I would just like to thank you so much on behalf of my wife and myself for doing an excellent job of organising what looks like a fantastic trip with excellent hotels included, flights and car driver with transfers etc. I will have no hesitation in using your services or recommending you in future and your professionalism for both this trip and Kabini has been very well appreciated by us by. The end product of which will give us both fond memories for many years to come.

                        You were absolutely right, IT WAS THE BEST HOLIDAY WE EVER HAD!! Thanks for persuading us to take this package, it was more than it’s worth. The entire team of Jungle lodge was very cordial, we all are much impressed by their professionalism and in depth knowledge about the wild life.

                        It was a wonderful experience for us. All your arrangements were up to the mark.
                        All hotels and transportation arrangements were excellent. Though we had faced some problems with hotel at Kedarnath you handled it swiftly and efficiently. Thanks for your support and prompt response.
                        The driver (Mahesh) just was very cooperative, polite and friendly. His driving skills were excellent and safe.

                        Our experience was way Soul satisfying after a very long time. Pachmari is absolutely beautiful place to visit. All the resorts were good - especial remark to the Rock end manor and Tawa resort ..staff was helpful and polite with no hassle..food was delicious but on the very same page Bison resort didn't met the standards though we managed any how. The trip ended with a blink but we had a good time .
